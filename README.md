# dupli_notdupli
This is a project developed using machine learning technique called NLP(Natural Language Processing) where in one can find out whether the two given statements are duplicate/having same meaning or different. The Data-set used is from Kaggle Pair of Duplicate questions by Quora.
The overall project required-
1. Importing requirements and dataset
2. Defining the Pre-Process Function which included Lemmatization,demojization,decontraction etc.
3. Feature Engineering
4. Studying some advanced features like fuzzy features
5. Hyper-parameter tuning
6. Checking accuracy on RandomForest and XGBoost Classifier

I also had plans to  deploy this on local host website using Pycharm and Heroku but there was some issue regarding authentication hence I couldn't, so here in this repository I have the jupyter notebook to the code. 

I achieved an accuracy of 79.91% using my model. Some other models have that had the best accuracy were around 85%.
